# user-datenbank
First attempt at sorting data with Javascript in a UI. 

An old project from 2022. The website should grap data from UserData.json in the data folder and visualise on a website.
There are alos functions to filter the data, for example by the position or age of the users. 

This project was uploaded years after it was started.
